Note: Controversial list of things currently broken and controversial
solutions for them.

Coding Standard
===============

* no external libraries in src/, they go to external/

* no SVN keywords, as nobody uses them anyway

* proper organisation in subdirectories, no files in src/*.?pp

* proper separation between engine and game specific code (especially
  sound and video handling)

* proper include guards

* move SVN to http://code.google.com

* move bugtracker to http://code.google.com (much simpler, less useless)

* normalize #include directives (all refer to top level dir)

* use SCons instead of CMake

* make code -Werror clean

* make code clean: "-O2", "-g3",
                     "-ansi",
                     "-pedantic",
                     "-Wall",
                     "-Wextra",
                     "-Wnon-virtual-dtor",
                     "-Weffc++",
                     "-Wconversion",
                     "-Werror",
                     "-Wshadow",
                     "-Wcast-qual",
                     "-Winit-self", # only works with >= -O1
                     "-Wno-unused-parameter",

* do not use raw pointer, especially not for Sprite and Surface

* properly separate data members and member functions, don't mix them
  in the same section

* write namespaces like: "namespace NameSpace {", no newline before the {

* only do one variable initialization per line, not multiple as its
  currently often done in initialization list

* conditional includes should be indended (makes it easier to handle in include optimization):

#ifdef FOOBAR
#  include "foobar.hpp"
#endif

* GameObject::RemoveListenerListEntry: Ughs, somebody trying to
  implement a list class within in the GameObject?!

* remove overuse of multi-inheritance 

* remove overuse of friend'ship

* mark interfaces as interfaces (ISerializable or SerializableInterface)

* replace random generator with mersene twister and/or move to external/


Comments
========

<Mathnerd314> now, OpenAL I disagree with. The CMake module
specifically says that you should include as <al.h>, because the path
components differ between platforms

version.h was just a recompilation optimization, but ok...

<Mathnerd314> btw, grumbel: obstack should count as an external (though not obstackpp)
