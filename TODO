Note: Controversial list of things currently broken and controversial
solutions for them.

Coding Standard
===============

* no external libraries in src/, they go to external/

* no SVN keywords, as nobody uses them anyway

* proper organisation in subdirectories, no files in src/*.?pp

* proper separation between engine and game specific code (especially
  sound and video handling)

* proper include guards

* move SVN to http://code.google.com

* move bugtracker to http://code.google.com (much simpler, less useless)

* normalize #include directives (all rever to top level dir)

* use SCons instead of CMake

* make code -Werror clean

* make code clean: "-O2", "-g3",
                     "-ansi",
                     "-pedantic",
                     "-Wall",
                     "-Wextra",
                     "-Wnon-virtual-dtor",
                     "-Weffc++",
                     "-Wconversion",
                     "-Werror",
                     "-Wshadow",
                     "-Wcast-qual",
                     "-Winit-self", # only works with >= -O1
                     "-Wno-unused-parameter",

Comments
========

<Mathnerd314> now, OpenAL I disagree with. The CMake module
specifically says that you should include as <al.h>, because the path
components differ between platforms

version.h was just a recompilation optimization, but ok...
