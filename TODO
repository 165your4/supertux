Note: Controversial list of things currently broken and controversial
solutions for them.

Coding Standard
===============

* use SCons instead of CMake

* make code clean: "-O2", "-g3",
                     "-ansi",
                     "-pedantic",
                     "-Wall",
                     "-Wextra",
                     "-Wnon-virtual-dtor",
                     "-Weffc++",
                     "-Wconversion",
                     "-Werror",
                     "-Wshadow",
                     "-Wcast-qual",
                     "-Winit-self", # only works with >= -O1
                     "-Wno-unused-parameter",

* do not use raw pointer, especially not for Sprite and Surface

* only do one variable initialization per line, not multiple as its
  currently often done in initialization list

* remove overuse of multi-inheritance 

* remove overuse of friend'ship

* maybe mark interfaces as interfaces (ISerializable or SerializableInterface)

* split files with multiple classes into multiple files with one class each


TODO
====

* GameObject::RemoveListenerListEntry: Ughs, somebody trying to
  implement a list class within in the GameObject?!

* replace random generator with mersene twister and/or move to external/

* check the code with Valgrind

* static vs anonymous namespace

* use Vector in Physics for 'a' and 'v'

* add --datadir DIR (data/) and --userdir DIR (~/.supertux/)

* make gravity a constant

* funky side effect of too much global variables: when having a
  savegame with large or firetux and then starting that game, Tux in
  the menu background will grow and be visible that way for a fraction
  of a second

* write scripts for include sorting and include guard checking that
  can be run automatically

* md5.hpp and random_generator.hpp could go to external/

* rename Vector -> Vector2f

* get rid of global SDL_Screen* screen variable

* identify all global variables and make them ugly (g_ or globals::)

* get rid of SCREEN_WIDTH/SCREEN_HEIGHT

* is version.h actually needed?

* resolution menu entry moves the wrong way around

* write scripts to automatically check for:

  - all includes are relative to top level dir

  - include guards are proper

* move SVN to http://code.google.com (maybe one day)

* move bugtracker to http://code.google.com (much simpler, less useless)

* having dictionary_manager in Lisp is extremely ugly

* enforce proper naming of files to match their class

* get rid of DEBUG and conditional compilation, these should be
  reserved for a few tiny cases, not spread all over the code

* split particlesystem_interactive

* Renderer::apply_config() needs to handle fullscreen switching

* collect all manager classe into globals.hpp

* more moving directories around?

* implement PNG screenshot

* GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two returns 1 on MatroxG450, while it
  returns "Missing" in glew info, something wrong

SuperTux Editor
===============

* +/- zoom buttons do not zoom to the center of the screen

* Object Tool should behave more like Inkscape:

  - LMB on an object to select
  - LMB on the background to start a select-rectangle
  - LMB+move to drag objects it around
  - Shift+LMB to add an object to the selection
  - RMB for context menu

* Select Tool should be removed (identical to Object Tool)

* replace tool crashes:

  Note: Applications can use GLib.ExceptionManager.UnhandledException to handle the exception.
System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.
  at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2[System.Object,System.Single].get_Item (System.Object key) [0x00000]

   at Gtk.Application.gtk_main()
   at Gtk.Application.Run()
   at Application.Main(System.String[] args)

* Replace Tool should document its functions in a status bar message

* Path Tool doesn't seem to do anything

* Tiles Tool doesn't display the current tile
