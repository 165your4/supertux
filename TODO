Note: Controversial list of things currently broken and controversial
solutions for them.

Coding Standard
===============

* no external libraries in src/, they go to external/

* proper separation between engine and game specific code (especially
  sound and video handling)

* normalize #include directives (all refer to top level dir)

* use SCons instead of CMake

* make code clean: "-O2", "-g3",
                     "-ansi",
                     "-pedantic",
                     "-Wall",
                     "-Wextra",
                     "-Wnon-virtual-dtor",
                     "-Weffc++",
                     "-Wconversion",
                     "-Werror",
                     "-Wshadow",
                     "-Wcast-qual",
                     "-Winit-self", # only works with >= -O1
                     "-Wno-unused-parameter",

* do not use raw pointer, especially not for Sprite and Surface

* properly separate data members and member functions, don't mix them
  in the same section

* write namespaces like: "namespace NameSpace {", no newline before the {

* only do one variable initialization per line, not multiple as its
  currently often done in initialization list

* conditional includes should be indended (makes it easier to handle
  in include optimization):

#ifdef FOOBAR
#  include "foobar.hpp"
#endif

* remove overuse of multi-inheritance 

* remove overuse of friend'ship

* maybe mark interfaces as interfaces (ISerializable or SerializableInterface)

* split files with multiple classes into multiple files with one class each


TODO
====

* GameObject::RemoveListenerListEntry: Ughs, somebody trying to
  implement a list class within in the GameObject?!

* replace random generator with mersene twister and/or move to external/

* check the code with Valgrind

* cleanup doxygen comments, use /** */, nothing else

* static vs anonymous namespace

* use Vector in Physics for 'a' and 'v'

* add --datadir DIR (data/) and --userdir DIR (~/.supertux/)

* make gravity a constant

* funky side effect of too much global variables: when having a
  savegame with large or firetux and then starting that game, Tux in
  the menu background will grow and be visible that way for a fraction
  of a second

* write scripts for include sorting and include guard checking that
  can be run automatically

* md5.hpp and random_generator.hpp could go to external/

* rename Vector -> Vector2f

* get rid of global SDL_Screen* screen variable

* identify all global variables and make them ugly (g_ or globals::)

* get rid of SCREEN_WIDTH/SCREEN_HEIGHT

* is version.h actually needed?

* resolution menu entry moves the wrong way around

* write scripts to automatically check for:

  - all includes are relative to top level dir

  - include guards are proper

* move SVN to http://code.google.com (maybe one day)

* move bugtracker to http://code.google.com (much simpler, less useless)
